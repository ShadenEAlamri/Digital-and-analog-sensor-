# Digital-and-analog-sensor-using-LDR
## introduction
This project investigates the application of a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) in various interactive scenarios, especially in gaming and digital projects. The LDR adjusts its resistance according to the surrounding light levels, enabling engaging interactions.


## Required Components
- **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)**
- **Resistor** (10kΩ for creating a voltage divider)
- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**

## Installation
1. **Connect the components** according to the circuit diagram:
   - Connect the LDR in series with a 10kΩ resistor to form a voltage divider.
   - Attach the LDR to an analog pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino.
2. **Connect the Arduino to your computer** using a USB cable.
3. **Download and install the Arduino IDE** if you haven't already.
4. **Open the Arduino IDE** and create a new sketch.
5. **Copy and paste the provided code** into the sketch.
6. **Select the correct board and port** from the Tools menu.
7. **Upload the code** to the Arduino.
